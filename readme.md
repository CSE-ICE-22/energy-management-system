## ⚡ Energy Management System

## 🌍 Project Overview  
When we are working with machines,robots and IOT devices there isn't a proper system to manage the energy. Our project bridges that gap by providing a **cost-effective and sustainable energy management solution** using a blend of hardware and software.

## 🚧 Problem Statement  
In systems operating with machines, robots, and IoT devices, energy is often consumed inefficiently due to the lack of real-time monitoring and intelligent control. This leads to excess consumption, increased costs, and system instability.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
Our Energy Management System (EMS) aims to:
- Optimize energy use across devices
- Provide real-time analytics of voltage, current, and usage time
- Offer data-driven insights via custom energy management algorithms

This hybrid hardware-software system ensures smarter energy consumption and sustainable device operation.

## ✨ Key Features  
- ⚙️ **Real-Time Voltage Analyzer** – Monitors live voltage levels for accuracy and alerts  
- ⚙️ **Real-Time Current Analyzer** – Tracks current draw to prevent overloads  
- ♻️ **Energy Optimization Engine** – Reduces wastage using dynamic algorithms  
- 📈 **Live Evaluations & Feedback Loop** – Responds to energy patterns in real time  
- 🧠 **Intelligent Algorithms** – Analyzes usage trends and applies best-fit power strategies
